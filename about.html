  <p >Leland is a full stack developer in Chicago, IL. <br><br>A graduate from DevBootcamp he is also a:<br><ul> Grammy Nominated designer <br> Freelance photographer<br> and grilling enthusiast.</ul>
Leland is a lifelong learner with a passion for playing and collecting music, documenting images and sound on the road and in places off the worn path. When he's not archiving or exploring he finds it important to use his fine arts background and love of Outsider art to inform and drive his own projects. To make work that communicates what we feel under our public personas, that engages the audience and creates as dialogue. While he lives in the city his heart is in the forests and fields of his native Iowa and with his fiance, Lizi.
