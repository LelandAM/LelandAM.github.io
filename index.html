  <h2>First Post</h2>
  <p>
Call to action, progress on a project, or evidence of research and reflection. Maybe something about me or maybe this shows some recent activity in the form of the newest page from my blog or a photo of instagram. Could even be just an image rather than text and the user will navigate with the above links instead.

<div>
  <h2>Older Post</h2>
  <p>
Perhaps the second most recent post or update. I would prefer users have something to read or think about here rather than just haveing to navigate through the links but maybe that could be achieved with a quote or info about me in a larger nice font.

  model site after book covers. sci-fi pulp if trashy and colorful sounds like fun or use some Chip Kidd inspiration. Also Alec Soth's site has nice simple but modern form, good color palette and mouseover color change that doesnt distract from the message
