        Machine learning is an advanced field of computer programming where complex algorhythms are written to allow the program to use statistics and pattern recognition to program itself as it works. Machine learning is already used in in a wide scale in search engines, spam filtering, data mining, netflix movie preferences, high frequency trading, facial recognition, and within our lifetime could yield true artificial intelligence. Machine learning is divided into several categories depanding on the type of learning signal and feedback involved.<br><br>

        <em>Supervised learning</em> - by analyzing given inputs and desired outputs the goal is to find a general rule to yield desired results.
        <br><br>

        <em>Semi-supervised learning</em> - Some but not all inputs and desired outputs are given.
        <br><br>

        <em>Unsupervised learning</em> - No labels are given to the algorhythm leaving it to find structure on its own. This is could be useful for finding hidden patterns or unknown solutions.
        <br><br>
        <em>Reinforced learning</em> - the computer interacts with a changing environment to perform a goal without being told if it has come close to the goal. Used in automated driving and game learning.
