    <h1>JavaScript Objects vs. Ruby Hashes</h1>

       While I am still very new to Ruby and JavaScript I can already see have a lot in common as well as unique ways to handle similar tasks. A great example of this is comparing the Ruby Hash to the JavaScript Object. Both of these exist to organize data into pairs of identifiers and values (Key Value pairs in Ruby, Properties in JS) within an object so those pairs can be easily called or changed.
       <br><br>
       In Ruby a Hash is defined simply with a name and equals sign:
       <br>
       <pre>
        #Ruby

        taco = {
        carb: "tortilla",
        meat: "carnitas",
        veg: "onion",
        }
        </pre>
        <br>
        In JavaScript the object is defined in almost the same way. There is a clear key/value relationship to the pair on either side of the colon, each entry is comma separated, held between curley braces and equated to a variable name. JavaScript just has an extra bit of formality and literal phrasing with it's required variable definition, "var", and the ubiquitous semicolon:
        <br><br>
        <pre>
        //JavaScript

        var bibimbap = {
        carb: "brown rice"
        meat: "bulgogi"
        veg: "kim chi"
        };
        </pre>
        <br>
        To operate these potentially hulking troves of data we also have similar operations, luckily they're delightfully simple. Strangely in this case the usually quirky JavaScipt has the easier operation and Ruby waves it's freak flag by demanding sqaure brackers around the called Key name. It makes sense though so we don't get mixed up trying to use a ruby method and call a value in an operation, just a little difference in syntax.
        <br><br>
        <pre>
        #Ruby

        #call a Value with a Key
        taco[:meat]

        #add a Key Value pair
        taco[:dairy] = "queso blanco"

        #Delete a Key Value pair
        taco.delete(:veg)
        </pre>
        <br>
        <pre>
        //JavaScript

        //access an object property
        bulgogi.meat

        //add an object property
        bulgogi.dairy = "fried egg"

        //Delete an object property
        delete bulgogi.veg
        </pre>
        <br>
        It is important and frustrating to note that each language also has several ways to do anything, in the above example I chose a mix to highlight some similarities and differences. The fact is, in JavaScript you can also call object properties with square brackets like: <br><br><pre>bulgogi[meat]</pre><br>You can also get real weird in Ruby and instead of using a simple colon to separate values you can write each as a string and separate with a <em>hash rocket</em> like so: <br><br><pre> "meat" => "carnitas"</pre><br>While I look for a chance to say <em>hash rocket</em> whenever possible there are easier ways to live your life. There is a varied and wonderful path of coding ahead so let's just have some fun out here and do our best.<br><br>
