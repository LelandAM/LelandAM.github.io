<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? Good, we both had a few blogs to look at as resources and agreed that sometimes the simplest design is the most effective.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? Wireframing certainly helps to visualize the site and break it down into divisions and tables.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? Before we had used Balsamiq and Mockflow and weren't satisfied, for this we used Mockingbird which has a collaborative feature so that was nice. We decided a good wireframe should highlight the hierarchies and semantics of the page you intent to design so you wont have to think twice about weather to use h2 or h4 when you're programming.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I got some practice with the samantics I'd learned like table and its associated bits and division
