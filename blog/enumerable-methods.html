        Arrays and Hashes are valueable tools because of their abilities to store or organize data, they have their own methods to add, delete, or access data. However, it is their ability to use Enumerable methods that makes them so handy. Enumerable is a module that can be included with other classes. Hash and Array are programmed to include Ennumerable which means they can both use the #each method to iterate through their data. That is why we are able to program ruby to do these complex tasks with containers of data rather than just holding it or moving it. Some other useful methods that comes with Ennumerable are #map, #group_by, #cycle, #select, #slice, #each_with_index, and #count. I am going to explain #map.
        <br><br>
        Enumerable has a handy method called #map that will iterate through an array or hash, run your block on each element, and return a new object filled with whatever your block returned or if no block is given it returns an assigned enumerator.
        <br><br>
        This same method can also be called with #collect but #map is a little more descriptive, evoking a journey or transformation, and #map is the preferred method to use. It is important to note that #map is also non-destructive but can be if called as #map!. While #map is similar to #each they are different because #map is used to convert each element to a new one and each just does something to the element, it's like the difference between a chemical and physical change in chemistry, with #map being the chemical change.
