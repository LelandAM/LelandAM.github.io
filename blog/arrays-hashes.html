    <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>

    <h2>Exercise 4.8</h2>

      <p>
        While learning to program in Ruby you'll soon find you have to work with more than one piece of input, or <em>argument</em>, at a time. Inevitably you'll create methods that have to work with a huge assortment of numbers or a bunch of strings, you could be eventually be responsible for indexing or cataloging a massive inventory or collection, you could have a huge set of data from a nation wide survey or just work to reorganize your personal collection of large numbers. When you encounter these ordered collections of objects they will fall into one of two categories depening on their organization and use. They are: <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>hashes</strong>. 
      </p><br>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>An array is an organized list of objects. These objects can be strings, integers, or floats and they are identifiable as an array because they exist between brackets separated by commas, like so:
      <br><br>
      <pre>array = ["three", 3, 33.3]</pre> 
      <br><br>
      Arrays are organized in a linear way to that each object can be called by it's place in the array, starting with 0 rather than 1. For example the first entry has a call number of [0] the second [1] the third [3] and so on.
      <br><br>
      <pre> 
      p [0] 
      p [1] 
      p [2] 
      <br>
      => three 
      => 3 
      => 33.3 
      </pre>
      <br><br>
      You will also encounter a multidimensional array which is an array of arrays. This organization follows the same idea that each object can be called based on it's place in the array but now it uses two call numbers; the first call number to specify from the larger order of arrays, starting with 0 for the first object, and the second call number, also starting with 0, to specify the object within that array.
      <br><br>
      <pre> array = [["mayo", "mustard"], ["onion", "tomato"], ["turkey", "ham"]]
      <br>
      <br> p[3][0]
      <br> =>turkey
      </pre>
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Hashes</h3>
      <p>
      A hash is also an organized list of objects <em>but</em> it has a different oragnization than an array, which requires a different sort of contents. Hashes still contain strings, integers, and floats like arrays but each one has a key assigned to it (like a variable) so we say hashes are made up of key-value pairs. So to call an object in a hash, instead of using it's place in line like we would in an array, we call the key to that object. This is useful because it offers a semantic organization that an array does not. For example while an array is just a big list of things the act of naming a key gives you the opportunity to give meaning to your data that can help to organize and call it later. <br><br>
      <pre>
        hash = {"dad" => "homer", "mom" => "marge" , "baby" => "maggie"}

        hash[baby]    # => maggie
