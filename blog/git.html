        Here in week one of Phase 0 in DBC our focus has been on learning to use GitHub as a Version Control System and making a habit of the commands required to use GitHub effectivley that will eventually allow us to work with teams of any size on larger projects. The Version Control System involves creating a temporary duplicate of the repository (the project at hand) that you can make and save changes to without corrupting the master version everyone else is working off. This is called checking out a branch. Once you check out a branch, you can create new material or change existing coding and structure and it won't change the master or anyone else's work untill your branch is merged with the master repo. As these updated branches are merged back to the master a giant timeline logs every change with a time stamp, all the changes, and the name of the user who made the changes. This timeline alone is a valuable tool for checking updates and progress but it also works like a time machine and a user can pull a branch from any spot on the timeline to backup or restore.

          To restate: Git helps keep track of changes with of log of every merge including every change, when it was changed, and who changed it. It also gives us the ability to revert to older saved versions.

          GitHub is especially useful to store code because it keeps our information in the cloud and has a built in community of coders. This is useful for sharing a master repo with team members, releasing an open source program into the world and for securely backing up data because local computers can be stolen or destroyed but the cloud cannot (probably).
