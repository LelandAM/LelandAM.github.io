    <h1>CSS Position Properties</h1>

    <section>
    <p>In CSS you have the ability to position objects using top, bottom, left and right properties. To make those work you must also define the position property because this declares how the object position will affect objects around it and where it's placement coordinates will be measured from. The position properties are: Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed</p><br>
  <h3>Static</h3>
  <p>The static position is the default position. Here each object appears aligned left on it's own line, lower than the one before it. Static elements are not affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.</p>
  <img src="../imgs/static.png" height="300px" width="320px">
  <img class="html-demo" src="../imgs/static-HTML.png" height="120px" width="320px">
  <br><br>
    <h3>Relative</h3>
  <p>An object assigned a relative position will move <em>relative</em> to it's static position. Objects around are unaffected, as if the object left a footprint behind so it's unoccupied space remains unfilled.
  </p>
  <img src="../imgs/relative.png" height="300px" width="320px">
  <img class="html-demo" src="../imgs/relative-HTML.png" height="120px" width="320px">
  <br><br>
    <h3>Absolute</h3>
  <p>An object with an absolute property will be affected by coordinates in relation to it's containing element rather than in relation to it's static position, think of it as positioning it in the window rather than from it's home space. Unlike relative position when the object assigned absolute position moves the other elements move to fill in it's former static space and it will cover of anything behind it.
  </p>
  <img src="../imgs/absolute.png" height="300px" width="320px">
  <img class="html-demo" src="../imgs/absolute-HTML.png" height="120px" width="320px">
  <br><br>
    <h3>Fixed</h3>
  <p>Fixed positioning is basically the same as absolute except the element will stay it's place in the browser window as you scroll up or down. Technically the object is positioned in relation to the browser window rather than the containing element, but objects will still move to take up it's static position and the object with be cover up others behind it.
