# 3.5 Your Website Solo Challenge Reflection

### ![My Live Site](/index.html)

## What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that all margin values stack up easily on nested elements and it's easiest to keep margins at zero for objects until you actually need to move them.

## What did you learn about CSS positioning?
There are many ways to get similar but different placements and it's super important to drag your window size all over the place to see how your elements react.

## What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I found that styling and color are much easier than placement. It can take a long time to get a table centered in a page and it's not always easy to find out why it's not working, even with the Chrome Dev Tools.

## What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned how to style hr lines and use a psuedo-selector to make my links change color when they are hovered over. I got much more practice moving elements around in the window and this exercise made me take a look at some other sites to check out their margins so I could make mine look better. Setting body margins goes a long way to improving the style of your site.
